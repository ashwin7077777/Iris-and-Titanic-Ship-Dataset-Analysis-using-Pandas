📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Using Pandas
Iris & Titanic Dataset Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on hands-on data analysis using Python and Pandas by working with two well-known real-world datasets: Iris and Titanic.
The goal of this project is to understand how raw data can be loaded, explored, cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Pandas.

The notebook demonstrates step-by-step data handling techniques, making it ideal for beginners and intermediate learners in Data Analytics and Data Science.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

Online CSV datasets (GitHub raw links)

📂 Datasets Used
1️⃣ Iris Dataset

Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width

Target: Species

Used to practice filtering, column operations, and feature engineering

2️⃣ Titanic Dataset

Passenger information including age, gender, fare, class, survival status

Used to practice data cleaning, missing value handling, and conditional analysis

🔍 Key Concepts Covered
📥 Data Loading

Loaded datasets directly from online sources using pd.read_csv()

🔎 Data Exploration

Viewing data using:

.head(), .tail()

.shape

.info()

.describe()

🧹 Data Cleaning

Identified missing values using:

.isnull().sum()

Understood which columns need cleaning or handling

🔁 Data Filtering & Conditional Selection

Used boolean conditions to:

Filter rows based on numeric values

Filter categorical columns

Applied multiple conditions using logical operators

🧠 Feature Engineering

Created new columns such as:

Sepal ratio (derived from sepal length and width)

Demonstrated how new insights can be created from existing data

📊 Column & Row Operations

Accessed specific columns and rows

Performed arithmetic operations on columns

Compared values across different features
